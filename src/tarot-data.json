    "per_game_data.csv": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated."

    "Celtic Cross": "The Celtic Cross spread is the oldest known and without a doubt, the most popular pattern for Tarot readings. It is said that the survival of this spread is due to the energy from the amount of people who use this particular spread daily, and the decades of use throughout the world.\n\n\nIt is divided into two sections, namely the “Circle/Cross” on the left side, made up of two crosses – a central one (two cards) nested within a larger cross (six cards), and the Staff on the right side, as shown in the above diagram. The “Circle/Cross” stems from the Celtic cross which can be found throughout the country of Ireland. It symbolizes the unity of all events."
